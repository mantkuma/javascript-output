const shape = {
  radius: 10,
  diameter() {
    return this.radius * 2;
  },
  perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius,
};

console.log(shape.diameter());
console.log(shape.perimeter());
// 20;
// NaN;

// Note that the value of diameter is a regular
// function, whereas the value of perimeter is an arrow function.

// With arrow functions, the this keyword refers to its current surrounding scope,
// unlike regular functions! This means that when we call perimeter, it doesn't refer to the shape object, but to its surrounding scope (window for example).
